# Content FAQs

## Can I use 4K 360 videos?

Yes, but with a few limitations.

4K (3840x2160) videos can be used in the experiences meant for viewing on a PC or Oculus Go. These are currently incompatible with mobile phones.

We recommend you downsize your 360 videos to 2K (2048x1024) to make your content compatible everywhere, unless meant exclusively for PC / Oculus Go.

<!-- ## How to capture 360 images using a mobile phone?

[Cardboard Camera](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.vr.cyclops&hl=en_IN/) is a mobile app that can capture 360 images compatible with the GMetri Editor. 

Install the app on any mobile phone (android and ios) and follow the instructions in-app to capture a 360 image. The captured image is in the format of *.vr.jpg. 

![captured photo](https://r.vrgmetri.com/image/q_90/gb-web/portal-docs/assets/img/screenshots/foto_no_exit.jpg#boxShadow "captured photo")

The photos captured using this app can be converted to Equirectangular images here. The converted image is a stereoscopic equirectangular image - top and bottom images for two eyes. 

![converted photo](https://r.vrgmetri.com/image/q_90/gb-web/portal-docs/assets/img/screenshots/foto_no_exit_converted.jpg#boxShadow "converted photo")

Crop the image horizontally in half and you will have a monoscopic equirectangular image (top half of the original) to be used in the Editor.

## How to clean up the tripod?

Tripods, Monopods or Drones often leave ghost marks at the bottom of your 360 footage.

![tripod](https://r.vrgmetri.com/image/q_90/gb-web/portal-docs/assets/img/screenshots/tripod.png.jpg#boxShadow "tripod")

Removing tripods can often be tedious, and the simplest way is probably just to cover it up!

Use your logo, or any other image and add it at the bottom in the editor to make your problem disappear. This saves additional work, and is a great way to push in some branding.

However, if you really want to clean up the tripod from your footage completely, here's how you could do that.

Here is a quick tutorial on how to remove the tripod using Adobe Photoshop, Premiere Pro or After Effects:

Mettle Sky Box is now a part of the Adobe Suite (>Adobe CC 2018). You can use the same features from the tutorial using the now inbuilt features of After Effects, like this:

![effects](https://s.vrgmetri.com/gb-web/portal-docs/assets/img/screenshots/effects.JPG#boxShadow "effects")

Use the "Immersive Video>VR Converter" effect in place of "Mettle Skybox Converter"

Use "Window>VR Comp Editor" instead of "Skybox Composer"

## How to create an XR Experience Storyboard?

Before you commence creating experiences on GMetri, it is always good to have a clear outline of what you're building.

While there are many ways to create a storyboard (we have seen some great examples across the clients), here is an outline of the internal story-boarding process, something you could simply use to get started.

### Experiences are Stories

Great experiences have a strong narrative, subtle or otherwise. Being the personal experience VR is, all your viewers are the protagonists of their own stories.

Creating a great storyboard solidifies this story and gives it structure and appeal. This is a process that would require brainstorming with key stakeholders involved - you get more ideas this way, and align early on the intent, content, mode and narrative.

- **Context**

    A baseline of the story should be created from the experience brief. To arrive at a baseline story we first need to identify the following:
    
    * What is the purpose of the experience?
    * Who is the final user?
    * What does the experience creator intend to impart to the user?
    * What is the main target device / hardware that will be used for viewing the experience?
    * What are the KPIs that will define the success of your experience?

    User profiling should include these key points:
    
    * Age, Demography
    * Tech Literacy
    * Language preference
    * Understanding Level of your content
    * Interest levels and incentive to view your experiences

- **Baseline**

    Once we have identified these, we proceed to create a skeletal storyline of the experience - the baseline. It will include the following:
    
    * What is the problem identified from the experience brief
    * The solution to the problem in a quick narrative
    * Are there any characters in the experience other than the user, and if so what is their relation to the user and how will they interact
    * Identified scenes/scenarios to efficiently put out the solution

- **Sketches**

    Once we have a baseline story, we sketch out all the scenes that will best work for the identified scenarios. These sketches will add a few details to the baseline and will inform us of how well the scene will impart its story to the user. 
    
    These sketches also involve the identification of:
    
    * The different scenes of your experience, and their intention - learning, assessments or engagement
    * Where is the user led by the storyline (game-terminology: Cut Scenes)
    * Where is the user interacting with the story and how this affects its progression
    * Will the interaction of the user affect the storyline frequently? If so, we make a the decision tree for different scenarios within the realm of possibilities.
    * The design language, and branding of the experience

- **Storyboard**
    
    The sketches have now fleshed out the baseline story with some details. It is time to make it into a functional script that will help everyone involved, including the execution teams, to understand how the experience is going to be created.
    
    Keep the following in mind to help you make the experience wholesome to keep the user engaged:
    
    * Maximum involvement of senses - Change the perception of the user by affecting multiple senses - visual and auditory at the least
    * Introduce new elements while keeping content relate-able
    * The vibe of your experience - how does the placement of elements impact this?
    * Motion - introduce movement to add dynamism without overdoing it so it doesn't become distracting
    * Design Language - determines the mood and character of objects in your scene
    * Color palette - affects emotions

    This will involve:
    
    * Identifying shoot locations (if required)
    * Finalizing the different characters and their roles (including dialogue)
    * A mood-board to understand the visual styling
    * All assets required for construction of the scenes (approach creatively and use the 360° space as the canvas)

We can create the storyboard inside the editor using primitive shapes and elements. This will give us an opportunity to think spatially and come up with better ways to represent different scene elements so that they are incorporated within the environment naturally.

- **Things to keep in mind while storyboarding learning / training experiences**

    * Clear communication - the user should relate to the speaker and should retain the attention to the speaker
    * Break things down to simple, bite-size components
    * Keep users engaged by making them perform tasks and interact with their environment frequently
    * We recommend occasional breaks - create large open spaces with minimal information and interactivity to avoid restriction and give a breather. This can break the monotony of the learning environment and refresh the user.
    * Improve visual recall by using strong shapes and color hues in simplified graphics along with pre-existing identifiable visual elements (icons)
    * Frequently reward the user positively, by showing appreciation and implementing score system - this will help boost their confidence and also inform them of their performance
    * A long term reward system that gives the user an overall goal over the story can also hold their attention better.
    * Gamify as many scenarios as possible to challenge the user and keep them hooked.
    * Carrot vs Stick approach
      * Unfortunately, the training industry often follows a stick approach - we have to drive people by force to complete their modules.
      * GMetri can enable gamified modules, which can be integrated with several reward mechanisms that incentivize training for employees via one or more of the following:
        * Lottery: If you log in and complete one training/refresher module in a day, your name enters a lottery, and the winner gets a reward.
        * Treasure Hunt: There are five coins to be found in the closing scenes of training modules, randomly distributed. If you find 5, you will get a reward.
        * Daily/Weekly Leader-board: Highest scoring employees in a certain time frame get rewarded.
    
## How to add a QR Code Scanner in an experience?

QR codes are widely used these days to give quick access to a lot of things. In the GMetri Platform, you can scan a QR code to open a web-page link within the experience as an overlay and go back to the experience seamlessly.

It is now very simple to leverage QR code technology in your VR experience using the GMetri Platform. This is how you do it:

Add a QR Code Reader element in a scene.

![add qr](https://r.vrgmetri.com/image/q_90/gb-web/portal-docs/assets/img/screenshots/qrbutton.png.jpg#boxShadow "add qr")

Now to activate it, add a rule saying when an element is clicked then the QR Code Reader should appear.

![activate qr](https://r.vrgmetri.com/image/q_90/gb-web/portal-docs/assets/img/screenshots/qractivate.png.jpg#boxShadow "activate qr")

And you are done! Here is what it looks like when you open the QR Code Reader from within the experience and after you scan the code.

![qr example](https://r.vrgmetri.com/image/q_90/gb-web/portal-docs/assets/img/screenshots/qrexample.png.jpg#boxShadow "qr example")

Now to activate it, add a rule saying when an element is clicked then the QR Code Reader should appear.

## How to run GMetri Experiences offline?

All experiences created on the GMetri Platform can be run offline. The offlining feature depends on the subscription plan chosen by your organization.

To run a GMetri VR experience offline, follow the following steps:


1. Open the experience that you wish to run offline. 
2. Find the storage option.

* Others who want or need a standard for web accessibility, including for mobile accessibility

GMetri Platform is **WCAG AAA** compliant. AAA refers to the highest level of success criteria. 

To understand different levels of conformance, head [here](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#conformance/).

## How to compress videos?

View [compression guidelines](../Guidelines/Content_Guidelines/compression.md/).


## Why do my panoramic photos look less than stellar?

The GMetri platform does not downgrade any images uploaded in any way. If there is any quality variance, it may be due to the camera settings or the export/compression settings. Here are a few things you can try to make sure you get the best quality out of your camera:
First, try to zoom out using the editor's zooming feature. If that didn't work,

- Ensure your Camera Firmware is up to date 
- Your Fusion Studio app also needs to be updated
- Clean the camera lens before taking pictures to avoid smudges 
- While exporting from Fusion Studio, you can also adjust the colour settings to make the image look better
- If you are compressing your images, there will be a drop in quality. Find the best compression to quality ratio that works for you by trying them out for yourself. GMetri Suggested Compression for JPEG - [squoosh](https://squoosh.app/) and for PNG - [tinypng](https://tinypng.com/)

## How to set up the camera view at the beginning of the scene?

We can set up the camera view at the beginning of each scene, by accessing the scene properties. You can do this by selecting the scene in the Structure tab and then open up the Properties tab. The scene has the following properties:

- **Scene Yaw Correction** - Which will set the direction the scene will start with, in yaw (horizontal direction)
- **Scene Pitch Correction** -  Which will set the direction the scene will start with, in pitch (vertical direction)
- **Scene Reset Rotation** - Which will reset the scene rotation to the Scene Yaw and Pitch Correction values every time the scene is changed to this current scene 
- **Scene Gyro Lock** - Which will lock the gyroscope of your device, ensuring your content remains on screen no matter how you turn your mobile device

For example, if you want the scene to start every time looking 70° to the right, set Scene Yaw Correction to 70° (or -70° for turning left) and switch on Scene Reset Rotation.
