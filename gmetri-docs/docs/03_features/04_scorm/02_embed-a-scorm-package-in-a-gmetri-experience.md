# Embed a SCORM package in a GMetri experience

Once you create an [experience](https://docs.gmetri.com/Features/Create/experiences/) on the GMetri platform, you can embed an external SCORM package inside the experience.

## Embed SCORM element

1. In your experience, add an `Embed SCORM` element.
   
   ![add element](https://s.vrgmetri.com/image/w_600,q_90/gb-web/portal-docs/assets/img/screenshots/add-embed-scorm.png)

2. Once the element has been created, select the element in the right bar. Then click on properties and paste the link of your desired SCORM package.

3. Click on the Add Rules icon.
4. Create a rule such that when the scene loads, your newly created Embed SCORM element should appear.

5. Click on the Player button, and click on Open In New Window. This will open a preview of your 
   experience in a new window, and once the scene loads, you will see your SCORM package displayed.
