# Export GLTF from 3DS Max

GLTF Models can be exported from the 3D software [3ds Max](https://www.autodesk.in/products/3ds-max/overview) using a third party script - [babylon.js](https://doc.babylonjs.com/resources/3dsmax#how-to-install-the-3ds-max-plugin) GLTF Exporter.

Here is the complete [documentation](https://doc.babylonjs.com/resources/3dsmax/) on the babylon.js exporter for 3ds Max. 

After installing babylon.js, a new menu button will appear in your 3ds Max. Clicking on it will bring up this screen.

You can export either GLTF/GLB format. The editor supports both formats. Select one format and select your export folder and then click export.
