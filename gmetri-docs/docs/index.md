Here's an XR experience that was built for spreading awareness during the COVID-19 pandemic, on how to wash your hands. The experience first provides a step-by-step explaination to viewers on how to wash their hands properly and then makes them play a game that helps them assess their understanding. The platform then tracks their scores and generates a public leaderboard.
