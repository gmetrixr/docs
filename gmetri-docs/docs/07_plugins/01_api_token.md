# API Tokens

To use **GMetri Plugin API**, you will first need to create an account on the GMetri Platform. 

If you don't already have one, head [here](https://portal.gmetri.com/signup) and create an account.
When you create an account on GMetri, an **API token** will be automatically generated for you and can be found on the **Profile** page.

:::info
Users on any plan can develop plugins using the plugin APIs
:::

Use this **token** to make [REST API](/docs/plugins/rest_api) calls to create, view and edit your experiences.
