# Deployment

Once an experience is built, it's time to deploy the experience so that others can open and view your experiences. This is done by creating deployments.

## Create Deployment 

To create a deployment:

- Open editor and go the the Publish tab on the left bar menu.
- Find the section named `Active  Deployment` and click on `New Deployment`.
- At this point, toggle the `LIVE` switch to expand the deployment options. This will also publish your experience at the provided link in the expansion.

This will show up options with a QR code that links to the deployment viewing page.

Once you create an experience you can easily share it with everyone by creating a deployment. You have complete control over who can view an experience you created. This is done using **Viewer Groups**.

## Tweaking Deployment

To enable people to view the experiences you create on the GMetri Platform, one needs to:

- Create a deployment for the experience.
- Make the deployment live.

### Viewer restrictions

- You can choose who gets to see your experiences. This is done by selecting a particular [`Viewer Group`](./Publish/Authentication/viewer_groups).
- Head over to the `Location` tab to restrict viewers based on their geo-location or enable viewer location tracking.

### Adding metadata

Add Metadata to your Depoloyments to improve the experience. This allows you to control the HTML metadata of your experinece to change the page title (appears on the browser tab), description and tags. This helps in better search engine optimization (SEO) specific to your requirements.
