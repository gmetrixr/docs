# Embed a SCORM package in a GMetri experience

## Description

Once you create an [experience](https://docs.gmetri.com/Features/Create/experiences/) on the GMetri platform, you can embed an external SCORM package inside the experience.

## Embed SCORM element

1. In your experience, add an `Embed SCORM` element.
   
   ![add element](https://s.vrgmetri.com/image/w_600,q_90/gb-web/portal-docs/assets/img/screenshots/add-embed-scorm.png)

2. Once the element has been created, select the element in the right bar. Then click on properties and paste the link of your desired SCORM package.

4. Create a rule such that when the scene loads, your newly created Embed SCORM element should appear.

   experience in a new window, and once the scene loads, you will see your SCORM package displayed.
