# Using Variables

Variables can be used in two ways:

1. Using substitution in many elements
2. In Rules

## Using Variables through text substitution

Most text areas support variable substitution.

As an example, to show the value of a variable in a `Text` element, add the name of the variable you want to use in **double curly brackets** `{{VARIABLE-NAME}}`

## Using Variables in rules

Rules allow you compare, set, increment values of any variable
