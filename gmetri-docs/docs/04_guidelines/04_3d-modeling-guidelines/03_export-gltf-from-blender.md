# Export GLTF from Blender
GLTF Models can be exported from the 3D software [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) using its inbuilt GLTF Exporter, that can be enabled in User Preferences > Add-ons.

Here is an extended video tutorial on working in Blender to export GLTF Models made by The Khronos Group (makers of GLTF format).
