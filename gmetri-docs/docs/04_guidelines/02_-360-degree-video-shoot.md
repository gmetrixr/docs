# 360 Degree Video Shoots

360 Shoots are done using a 360 camera like **GoPro Fusion 360, Ricoh Theta V, Samsung Gear 360** etc., or using a **custom rig of multiple cameras**. No matter the camera used, make sure the shoot proceeds in the following manner.   

### Reconnaissance

- Do a recce of the shooting site and select the **best available locations** on-site that can enhance the experience of the viewer in 360. 
- Check the **light levels** and decide on a time of day to do the shoot. Get all the **interior lights** working, by the staff on site. 
- Make sure to ask the site team to **clean up the location** for the shoot and have all the **requisite props and items** ready.
- **Debrief** any actors about their **roles** and if required, give them a **script** for their perusal. Ask them to **rehearse** their scripts a few times before the shoot.
- **Inform** the on-site personnel to **groom** well on the day of the shoot. 

### Day of shoot

- Make sure to check if everything noted on the recon day has been done on-site.
- Do a **test run** with the actor/s and get them comfortable.
- Always set the camera at a **height of 5’2”** (average eye height) while mounted on a monopod/tripod.
- Setup the camera and other props as required and do test runs to check on **light conditions** and **scene aesthetics**. 
  - Camera settings should be sorted outwhile doing this. Get it right before the actual shoot. 
- **Inform** the non-performing personnel on-site that it is a 360 shoot and everyone will be visible to the camera and so they have to focus on their work while the shoot is in the process or get them away from the shoot location if required. 
- Emphasize on keeping the environment **as normal** and every day **as possible**. At **no point** during the shoot should anyone be **looking** at the **camera** or the **actor**.
-  Equip the actor with a **collar mic** and make sure it is **recording** before every shot.
- **Inform** the actor/s that they should **wait 3 seconds** after the **"Action"** call to start and to keep maintaining their stance at the end of their performance for **3 seconds** before you call **"Cut"**.
- If using a **GoPro Fusion 360** camera or any other similar camera, **position** the camera such that the **stitch area is along a natural line in the environment**, which can help **fix any stitch line** in post-production.


### During the shoot

- Make sure the person handling the camera is **not seen** by the camera at any point. 
- Call the **scenes** and **take numbers** loud and clear as soon as the camera starts recording. Give the **"Action"** call so that the actor knows when to begin and call **"Cut"** at the end of the shot. Have a **sheet** marked with all the takes, while selecting the ones that look perfect.
- **Post** a few people across all the **ingress** and **egress locations** within the environment, away from the camera’s line of sight, to **stop people from entering** during the shoot. 
- **Position** the actor in front of an **empty wall** or any background with **little clutter** and **void of any distractions**. 
- If the actor is not very comfortable with long dialogues and keeps forgetting them, suggest and provide a **teleprompter** with their dialogues on it. There are a lot of good **teleprompter apps for smartphones** that can be used for this purpose. Place the phone right **under the camera**, so that it won’t look like the actor is **looking elsewhere** for the whole dialogue delivery. 
- For **long-duration** shoots, keep the actor feeling and looking **fresh** to avoid tiredness showing in any of the footage.
- Try to **minimize the movement** of the actor to **within 90°** and have some **empty wall or panel** nearby to **project any data** in post-processing. 
- Take a **photo** and a **short clip** at every position of the camera, **without the main actor**. This can come in handy when **editing the footage** in post-processing.
