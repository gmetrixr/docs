# Authentication Mechanisms

Authentication mechanisms help you restrict access to a deployment of your experience. You can use various types of authentication mechanisms for access restrictions as per your choice.

Authentication mechanisms provided for a deployment can be of one of the following types:

1. [Social](./Authentication/social/)
2. [Public](./Authentication/public/)
3. [Editor](./Authentication/editor/)

Apart from these, you can also set the deployment's authentication to restrict its access to a particular
 set of viewers by creating [Viewer Groups](./Authentication/viewer_groups/). 

## Enabling Authentication

When a new deployment is created, its authentication is set to [Public](./Authentication/public/) by default.
You can see this in the `Authentication` drop down of the deployment card.

Here you can set the authentication to any of the modes as stated above.
